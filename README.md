# Motor_vehicles_crashes_data_analytics

Road traffic is the most common traffic in the world. We commute daily using cars, motorbikes, or buses ... How safe for us to go out of the house and enter road traffic? Does road traffic become safer in the last ten years? Which states have the most incidents? What are some of the high-risk factors involved in vehicle crashes?
I used the dataset from https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/CrashAPI/ to get the crash data in the USA for the last ten years. The data is available through APIs, so we can stay updated when new data becomes available. The raw data was then cleaned and visualised using charts and a heat map.

Note:
- The heat map was generated using gmap. A valid API needs to be added to the code so that the heatmap can be generated.
